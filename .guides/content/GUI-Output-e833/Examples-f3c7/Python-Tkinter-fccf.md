`Tkinter` is a common library for `Python`. It is easy to learn and setup. 

Since python is an interpreted language, you don't need to compile your code. You can just run it and it will automatically open your application. 

{Run Python Tkinter | terminal}(cd /home/codio/workspace/Tkinter && python hello.py)
