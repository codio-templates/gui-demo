On the left you will find the **Virtual Desktop**, it appears to be empty now, but once you run an application, it will appear there. For this pack, you will be interacting with the included applications using the **top menu bar**. This will give learners more control over when or how to start the application. 

Look for this buttons:

Click on the arrows next to the buttons. In the first button you will find the applications (or commands) you can run; in the second one you are presented with a button to open the **Virtual Desktop** and then the option to open it inside Codio or as a new tab in your browser. **Feel free to play with this buttons now.**

Some applications won't run until you have opened the **Virtual Desktop**. One way around it is to open it when setting up the layout. Feel free to edit this Guide to see how the layout is set up.
