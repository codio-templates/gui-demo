This Starter Pack will help you learn best practices for setting up your own GUI stacks and assignments. Here you will find some example for Python and Java, but most of this instructions apply to any programming language or application.

Running graphical user interface (**GUI**) applications in Codio is as simple as outside Codio. Any application that runs in Ubuntu will be able to run in Codio.

Interacting with a **GUI** application will be as if your using an additional monitor for your computer.

You will have **copy/paste** functionality, but you won't be able to **drag and drop** directly from your computer.

For the most up-to-date information about GUI Based Output, please read our documentation [here](https://docs.codio.com/develop/develop/ide/boxes/installsw/gui.html).

## Requirements

- A stack you trust, you can start with a **Codio certified Stack** or one you own. Other stacks can give you a quick start, but if you are unsure about all the processes running in the background, it can affect the performance or cause compatibility issues.
- **X Server** installed in your stack, you can install it from **Install Software** inside **Tools** in the menu bar. 
- Instructions on how to install the **application** or **library** you want to use.
- Setup a `.codio` file inside your `workspace` folder.


|||info
The stack for this project is available in `Certified` tab in Codio. You can use it for your own projects if you plan to use Java and/or Python.
