To open/run an application, you can:

- Use the top menu bar if you need to compile it;
- Use an opening directive in the guides if you will run a simple command like a `Python` script; 
- Or use the `Autostart Support` which you will find inside **Install Software** inside **Tools** in the top menu bar for applications like `Spyder`.

You can use this as the starting point for your own projects.

When writing your commands, try to consider the following recommendations: 

- Try to avoid using long and complex one-line commands. If your instructions to run an application are complicated, consider using a `bash` script.
- When using paths, consider what happens once learners are in that folder. If you use relative paths, once you are inside a folder, it will fail if you run it again. 
- If you are running a third-party application, consider using the `Autostart Support` instead of a script. That way, your application will run in the background and it will continue its execution across multiple pages of the guide.
- Give learners some control over what is running and what to do if something fails. Consider giving them ways to restart the application.
